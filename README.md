Login Page
A login page for an inventory management system typically consists of a few key components:
1.	Email and Password Fields: The first and most important element of any login page is the fields where users enter their username and password. These fields should be clearly labeled and easy to find on the page.
2.	Forgot Password Link: It's important to provide users with a way to reset their password if they forget it. A "Forgot Password" link or button should be included on the login page.
3.	Submit Button: A prominent button that users can click to submit their login information and gain access to the inventory management system.
4.	Error Messages: If users enter incorrect login information, it's important to provide clear error messages that explain what went wrong and how to correct the issue.
